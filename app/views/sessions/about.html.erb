<p>Welcome to Dental Squid, the site that saves you time and money while maintaining your current service and relationships.</p>

<p>Dental Squid saves you time and money by allowing you to compare price and availability of over 100,000 dental products in one place at one time.  What makes Dental Squid unique is its ability to show you your price of any item at each of up to 5 dental distributors at one time.  No more calling multiple reps or jumping between distributor web sites. Just enter your order and let Dental Squid tell you who has the best price for each item and for the entire order.</p>

<p>Once you decide where the best price and availability is, hit order and Dental Squid will place your order using your account.  We don’t get in between you and your suppliers, all we do is provide you the most current and up-to-date pricing data so you can make the right decision.</p>

<p>Don’t waste any more time and money; use Dental Squid!</p>  
Same quality.  Same service.  Lower price.</p>
